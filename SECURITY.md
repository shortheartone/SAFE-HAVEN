# Security Policy

SAFE-HAVEN is a decentralized vault that holds real user funds on the Stellar network.
A vulnerability in the smart contract can result in permanent, irreversible fund loss.
We take every security report seriously and follow a rigorous coordinated-disclosure process.

## 1. Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| `0.1.x` (latest) | ✅ Yes | Active development; patches released as needed |
| `< 0.1.0` | ❌ No | Pre-release; unsupported |

Security patches are only issued for the current latest release. If you are running an older deployment, upgrade before assuming you are protected.

---

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for any security vulnerability.**

Public disclosure before a fix is deployed puts every user's funds at risk.

### How to report

**Email:** security@safe-haven.example.com
*(Replace with a monitored address before going to production. Consider a PGP-encrypted channel for critical reports.)*

**PGP key:** *(publish your PGP public key fingerprint here once available)*

**GitHub Security Advisories (alternative):** Use the [Private Security Advisory](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/security/advisories/new) feature to report directly through GitHub. This keeps the report private until a fix is ready.

Do not:

- Open a public issue
- Share details in the public Discord, Telegram, or any other community channel
- Commit a proof-of-concept to a public fork of this repository
- Contact individual maintainers on personal social media

---

## 3. What to Include in a Report

A complete report speeds up triage and reduces back-and-forth. Please include:

- **Summary** — A concise description of the vulnerability
- **Affected component** — Smart contract function(s), frontend path, or infrastructure
- **Affected version(s)** — The contract version or commit hash
- **Vulnerability class** — e.g., integer overflow, auth bypass, re-entrancy, storage corruption
- **Steps to reproduce** — The minimum sequence of calls or actions that trigger the issue
- **Proof of concept** — A failing test, CLI invocation, or transaction XDR (if available; not required)
- **Impact assessment** — Funds at risk? Which users? Estimated blast radius
- **Suggested fix** (optional) — If you have a patch idea, include it — but a report without a fix is still valuable

You do not need to provide a complete exploit to file a report.

---

## 4. Response Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|---|---|
| **Initial acknowledgement** | Within **48 hours** of receipt |
| **Triage complete** (severity confirmed) | Within **5 business days** |
| **Fix target communicated** | Within **7 days** for S1; within **14 days** for S2 |
| **Fix delivered (patch PR merged)** | Within **14 days** for S1 (critical); **30 days** for S2 (high) |
| **Public disclosure** | After fix is deployed AND embargo window has passed (see §5) |

If we cannot meet a target, we will communicate proactively on the private thread.

Silence past the 48-hour acknowledgement window is a bug in our process, not a signal that the report was ignored. Re-ping us.

---

## 5. Embargo and Coordinated Disclosure

### Embargo period

We follow coordinated disclosure. The default embargo is:

- **S1 (Critical):** 14 days from fix deployment, or earlier by mutual agreement
- **S2 (High):** 30 days from fix deployment, or earlier by mutual agreement
- **S3/S4:** Disclosed at the maintainer's discretion, usually with the release

During the embargo window, the vulnerability details are shared only with:

- The reporter
- The core maintainer team
- Any auditor or security reviewer directly involved in the fix
- Downstream partners directly affected (e.g., if a custodian relies on the contract)

### Reporter obligations during embargo

- Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until the embargo has lifted or you have received written clearance from the maintainer team
- Do not demonstrate the vulnerability on mainnet or testnet against funds you do not own
- Do not contact third parties (exchanges, custodians) about the issue without coordinating with the maintainer team first

### What happens when embargo lifts

1. A GitHub Security Advisory is published (see §11 for the template)
2. A `CHANGELOG.md` entry is added under `### Security`
3. A new patch version is tagged and released
4. A brief public post-mortem is published (optional, for high-impact vulnerabilities)

### Expedited disclosure

If an S1 vulnerability is already being actively exploited on mainnet, the embargo is waived and disclosure happens immediately alongside or after emergency patching.

## 6. Vulnerability Handling Process

```
Reporter sends email / GitHub Advisory
            │
            ▼
  [Acknowledged within 48h]
  Maintainer confirms receipt, opens a private tracking issue,
  assigns a severity, and names an incident lead.
            │
            ▼
  [Triage — within 5 business days]
  Incident lead reproduces the issue.
  Severity confirmed: S1 / S2 / S3 / S4.
  Fix deadline set.
            │
            ▼
  [Patching]
  Fix developed on a private branch.
  Internal review by at least one other maintainer.
  For contract changes: smart-contract security review required.
            │
            ▼
  [Staging verification]
  Fix tested on local node and testnet.
  All existing tests pass.
  New regression test added that directly covers the reported scenario.
            │
            ▼
  [Deployment]
  New contract version deployed to testnet, then mainnet.
  Frontend updated if applicable.
  New release tagged.
            │
            ▼
  [Disclosure — after embargo period]
  GitHub Security Advisory published.
  CHANGELOG.md updated.
  Reporter credited (with their permission).
  Post-mortem published for critical issues.
```

### Tracking and communication

- Every accepted report gets a private GitHub Security Advisory entry as the canonical tracking document.
- The reporter receives a status update at each stage transition.
- If an incident lead becomes unavailable, the triage facilitator (see BUG_TRIAGE.md) takes over.

---

## 7. Scope

The following are considered **in-scope** vulnerabilities for this project:

### Smart contract (highest priority)

- Any bug that can result in **fund loss or theft** from depositors
- **Auth bypass:** circumventing `require_auth()` in any mutating function
- **Re-entrancy** or checks-effects-interactions violations
- **Storage manipulation:** modifying another depositor's `VaultEntry` or `LedgerVaultEntry`
- **Admin privilege escalation:** gaining admin rights without the current admin's consent
- **Contract re-initialization** after `renounce_admin()` or `initialize()` has run
- **Penalty miscalculation** that over-charges or under-charges depositors
- **Incorrect TTL handling** that causes live deposits to expire prematurely
- **`deposit_by_ledger` missing upper-bound check** (known gap — tracked in Known Limitations)
- **Integer overflow / underflow** in amount arithmetic or ledger sequence comparisons

### Frontend

- XSS vulnerabilities that could lead to wallet compromise
- Incorrect transaction construction that submits wrong parameters to the contract
- Network passphrase mismatch that silently executes on the wrong network

### Infrastructure

- Secrets exposed in CI logs or GitHub Actions environment
- Dependency confusion or supply-chain attack via `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`

---

## 8. Out of Scope

The following are **not** in scope for this security policy:

- Stellar network-level vulnerabilities — report to [Stellar Bug Bounty](https://www.stellar.org/bug-bounty-program)
- Bugs in `soroban-sdk` itself — report to [stellar/rs-soroban-sdk](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-sdk/security)
- Issues requiring physical access to a user's private key or seed phrase
- Social engineering attacks targeting maintainers or users
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a realistic attack path
- Missing security headers on a static frontend with no server-side processing
- Rate limiting or DoS on the Stellar RPC — this is a network-level concern
- Vulnerabilities in Freighter wallet internals — report to the Freighter team

If you are unsure whether your finding is in scope, report it anyway. We would rather triage an out-of-scope report than miss a real issue.

---

## 9. Credit and Acknowledgement

We believe in crediting security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

By default, when a security advisory is published we will credit the reporter as:

> Reported by **[Name / Handle]** ([link to profile], [date])

If you prefer to remain anonymous, tell us in your initial report and we will publish the advisory without attribution.

We also maintain a **Hall of Fame** section in this file (below) for past reports. Entry into the Hall of Fame is opt-in.

### Hall of Fame

| Researcher | Vulnerability | Severity | Date | Advisory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| *(none yet — be the first)* | | | | |

---

## 10. Bug Bounty

There is currently **no active bug bounty program**. Vulnerability research is voluntary.

If a critical vulnerability is reported and leads to a fix that protects live user funds, the maintainer team will consider a discretionary reward on a case-by-case basis, subject to available project funds. This is not a guarantee.

This section will be updated if a formal bug bounty program is launched.

## 11. Security Advisory Template

Use this template when publishing a GitHub Security Advisory after an embargo lifts.

```markdown
## [SAFE-HAVEN-YYYY-NNN] <Vulnerability Title>

**CVE ID:** CVE-YYYY-NNNNN (if assigned)
**GHSA ID:** GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
**Severity:** Critical / High / Medium / Low
**CVSS score:** N/A or X.X (if calculated)
**Affected versions:** < X.Y.Z
**Fixed in version:** X.Y.Z
**Published:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Reporter:** Name / Handle (or "Anonymous")

### Summary

A one-paragraph description of the vulnerability suitable for public consumption.
Avoid overly specific exploit details that could be used to attack unpatched deployments.

### Impact

Who is affected, what can an attacker do, and what is the worst-case outcome?

- Affected users: all depositors / depositors using `deposit_by_ledger` / admin only
- Worst case: fund loss / auth bypass / incorrect query result / DoS

### Patches

Fixed in commit [abc1234](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/commit/abc1234)
and released in [v X.Y.Z](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z).

### Workarounds

If no patch is available, document any mitigations here.
If a deployed contract is immutable and cannot be patched, clearly state that.
