## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

[optional body]
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `ci`.

Examples:
```
feat(contract): add multi-depositor support
fix(storage): correct TTL bump on emergency withdraw
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Prerequisites

Install all recommended dev tools in one command:

```bash
make install-tools
```

This installs `cargo-watch`, `soroban-cli`, `cargo-audit`, and `cargo-deny`.

Alternatively, install individual tools manually:

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch      # for make watch
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-deny
```

## Local Development

```bash
# Full check: fmt + clippy + tests
make check

# Build optimized WASM and report size
make build && make optimize

# Full local dev environment (build + deploy + frontend)
make dev

# Auto-run tests on file change
make watch
```

## Performance Conventions

### Cache `env.ledger().timestamp()` in a local variable

Every call to `env.ledger().timestamp()` is a host-function invocation with a non-trivial cost in the Soroban execution environment. Always cache the result in a `let now` binding at the top of any function that reads the ledger timestamp more than once:

```rust
// good
pub fn some_fn(env: Env, depositor: Address) -> Result<(), VaultError> {
    let now = env.ledger().timestamp();
    if now < entry.unlock_time {
        return Err(VaultError::FundsStillLocked);
    }
    // ... use `now` again later without re-invoking the host
}

// bad â€” calls the host twice for the same value
pub fn some_fn(env: Env, depositor: Address) -> Result<(), VaultError> {
    if env.ledger().timestamp() < entry.unlock_time {
        return Err(VaultError::FundsStillLocked);
    }
    let elapsed = env.ledger().timestamp() - start;
}
```

This convention applies to any repeated host accessor (`env.ledger().sequence()`, `env.current_contract_address()`, etc.) â€” read once, store locally, reuse the binding.

## Contributing to Documentation

### FAQ

The SAFE-HAVEN project maintains a comprehensive **[FAQ](./FAQ.md)** with answers to 28+ common questions about setup, usage, troubleshooting, and advanced topics.

**How to contribute:**

1. **Add a new Q&A**: Identify a gap in the FAQ (from Discord, issues, or support tickets) and write a clear question & answer
2. **Improve an existing answer**: Clarify unclear answers, update code examples, add more detail
3. **Report an error**: Found a broken link, outdated info, or typo? File an issue or PR with the fix
4. **Suggest a topic**: Not sure how to write it? Open an issue with the topic and we'll help

See [**FAQ_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md**](./FAQ_CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on format, accuracy guidelines, and the contribution process.

## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

Use the appropriate GitHub issue template:

- **[Bug Report](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)** — for unexpected behaviour, crashes, or incorrect output. Include steps to reproduce, the actual result, and the expected result.
- **[Feature Request](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)** — for new functionality or improvements. Describe the problem you are trying to solve and why the existing behaviour is insufficient.
- **[Documentation](https://github.com/kenedybok3/SAFE-HAVEN/issues/new?labels=documentation)** — for FAQ improvements, broken links, or missing documentation

Filling in the template fully helps maintainers triage and reproduce issues faster.

> **Security vulnerabilities must not be filed as public GitHub issues.** See [Security Vulnerabilities](#security-vulnerabilities) below.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability — including smart contract logic bugs that could result in fund loss, auth bypasses, or storage manipulation — **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Public disclosure before a fix is available puts all users at risk.

Instead, follow the responsible disclosure process described in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md):

- Email **security@example.com** with a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and the potential impact.
- You will receive an acknowledgement within 72 hours and a fix target within 14 days for critical issues.
- We follow coordinated disclosure — please allow reasonable time to patch before any public disclosure.

## Before Opening a PR

- [ ] `make check` passes locally
- [ ] New tests added for any new behaviour
- [ ] README updated if the public API changed

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated under [Unreleased] with a summary of the change

## Required Status Checks

All PRs must pass the following CI jobs before they can be merged:

| Job | Description |
|---|---|
| **security-audit** | Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities (`cargo audit`) |
| **lint** | Ensures code formatting (`cargo fmt`) and passes Clippy lints |
| **test** | Runs all unit tests and doc tests |
| **deny** | Verifies license compliance and ban policy (`cargo deny`) |
| **build** | Compiles and optimizes the WASM binary for both stable and MSRV toolchains |
| **geiger** | Scans for unsafe Rust code |

> **Note:** These checks are enforced via branch protection rules in the GitHub repository settings.
> Make sure `main` and `develop` branches have these status checks configured as required.
> A PR that fails any of these jobs should not be merged until the failures are resolved.

## Submitting a PR

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.
2. Fill in the PR description with a summary of changes and what was tested.
3. Link any related issue with `Closes #<issue-number>`.

## Test Snapshots

Running `cargo test` may generate a `contracts/safe-haven/test_snapshots/` directory containing XDR snapshots of contract state produced by the Soroban test environment. These are transient build artefacts, not committed regression fixtures, and are listed in `.gitignore`. Do not commit them.

## Smart Contract Security Review

Any PR that modifies files under `contracts/` **must** be reviewed by a smart contract security reviewer before merging. This requirement is enforced via `.github/CODEOWNERS`. If you are adding or updating a contract file, ensure at least one listed CODEOWNER approves your PR.

> **Note:** CODEOWNERS entries are only active when the listed GitHub usernames correspond to real users with write access to the repository. If maintainers change, update `.github/CODEOWNERS` accordingly or the review requirement will silently be skipped.

## Utility Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/final_merge.sh` | Batch-merges a predefined list of PRs into `main`, auto-resolving conflicts by favouring the PR branch. |
| `scripts/smart_merge.sh` | Merges simple and complex PRs in two passes; fair-weather PRs merge without conflict resolution, complex PRs get automatic conflict handling. |
| `scripts/deploy_testnet.sh` | Deploys the optimized WASM contract to Stellar Testnet. Requires `SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY`. |
| `scripts/smoke_test_local.sh` | Runs smoke tests against a local Soroban standalone node. |

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repo ships a `.githooks/` directory with a pre-commit hook that runs formatting and lint checks locally so you catch issues before CI. Activate it with:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook runs:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`

If the hook fails, fix the reported issues and try committing again.
