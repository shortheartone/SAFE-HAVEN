A production-ready decentralized vault on the Stellar blockchain (Soroban) — with a full React/TypeScript frontend.

Tokens are locked in the smart contract until a future timestamp. Early exits are possible with a configurable penalty. Admin rights can be permanently renounced for fully trustless operation.

## Quick Start

### Smart Contract

```bash
# Prerequisites
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked soroban-cli

# Optional: jq for JSON parsing in smoke tests (apt-get install jq / brew install jq)

# One-shot: install all recommended dev tools
make install-tools

# Build
make build

# Test
make test

# Run all tests on file change (requires cargo-watch, installed by make install-tools)
make watch

# Full local dev environment (build + deploy + frontend)
make dev

# Deploy to testnet
export SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY=S...
make deploy-testnet

# Deploy to mainnet (the deployer must already be funded; no mainnet faucet exists)
export SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY=S...
make deploy-mainnet

# Redeploy a retained immutable WASM as a new contract ID
export SOROBAN_SECRET_KEY=S...
make rollback NETWORK=testnet ARTIFACT_DIR=deployments/testnet/<timestamp>
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_CONTRACT_ID to your deployed contract
npm run dev            # -> http://localhost:5173
```

See [`frontend/README.md`](./frontend/README.md) for the full frontend guide.

See [`DISASTER_RECOVERY.md`](./DISASTER_RECOVERY.md) for disaster scenarios, recovery procedures, roles, and escalation rules.

See [`MONITORING.md`](./MONITORING.md) for contract health checks, alert thresholds, storage/TTL monitoring, and failed-transaction observability.

See [`LEGAL.md`](./LEGAL.md) for Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, disclaimers, GDPR compliance, data retention policy, and the on-chain audit trail reference.

See [`SUPPORT.md`](./SUPPORT.md) for the version lifecycle, maintenance and support matrix, bug-fix SLAs by severity, and EOL policy.

See [`BRANCHING.md`](./BRANCHING.md) for the branching strategy, naming conventions, branch protection rules, release checklist, hotfix procedure, and rollback procedures.

See [`POSTMORTEM.md`](./POSTMORTEM.md) for the incident post-mortem process, blameless culture guidelines, post-mortem template, action item tracking, and quarterly review process.

Deployment artifacts are written to `deployments/<network>/<timestamp>/`, including raw and optimized WASM, contract ID, manifest, and checksum. Each deployment also updates `deploy_<network>.log` for CI compatibility. Soroban contracts are immutable, so rollback means deploying the retained previous WASM as a new contract and updating the frontend contract ID after verification.

## Overview

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Network | Stellar (Soroban) |
| Language | Rust |
| SDK | soroban-sdk v22 |
| Storage | Persistent (per-depositor) |
| Max deposit | 10^15 units |
| Max lock duration | 5 years |
| Min lock duration | 60 seconds |
| Early-exit penalty | 0-100% (basis points, set at deposit time) |

---

## How It Works

1. **Deposit** - User calls `deposit(token, amount, unlock_time, penalty_bps)` — tokens transfer into the contract
2. **Storage** - Contract stores a `VaultEntry` in persistent storage keyed by `(depositor, deposit_id)`
3. **Verification** - On `withdraw()`, contract checks `ledger.timestamp() >= unlock_time`
4. **Unlock** - Tokens returned to depositor. Otherwise call fails with `FundsStillLocked`
5. **Early exit** - `cancel_deposit()` returns funds minus penalty; penalty goes to `fee_recipient`
6. **Renewal** - The depositor can call `renew_deposit()` after unlock to set a new unlock time and penalty without moving or changing the amount
7. **Admin recovery** - Admin can emergency-withdraw any deposit (funds always go to depositor, never admin)
8. **Trustless mode** - Admin can be permanently renounced via `renounce_admin()`

## MEV Protection

SAFE-HAVEN includes built-in **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection** to prevent sandwich attacks and front-running. The system uses a **commit-reveal scheme** combined with **time-weighted average pricing (TWAP)** to detect and mitigate MEV extraction.

### Key Features

- **Commit-Reveal Scheme** — Depositors privately commit transaction details (via hash), then reveal after the commit is immutable. Prevents attackers from predicting and front-running orders.
- **Price Monitoring** — Continuous tracking of token prices; stores up to 24 hours of hourly price samples.
- **Sandwich Attack Detection** — Compares current price against TWAP. Deviations exceeding 200 basis points (2%) trigger attack detection.
- **MEV Recovery & Redistribution** — Recovered value is credited to affected users' MEV pools, which they can claim individually.
- **Transparent Event Logging** — All MEV detections, commits, and recoveries are emitted as on-chain events for audit and monitoring.

### MEV Protection API

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `mev_commit(depositor, deposit_id, commit_hash)` | Submit a private commit to enable MEV protection |
| `mev_reveal(depositor, deposit_id, token, amount, price, nonce)` | Reveal the commit and trigger MEV detection |
| `claim_mev_recovery(depositor)` | Claim recovered MEV from the pool |
| `get_mev_status_query(depositor, deposit_id)` | Query MEV protection status (`Unprotected`, `Committed`, `Revealed`, `AttackDetected`) |
| `get_mev_detections(depositor, deposit_id, offset, limit)` | Paginated view of detected attacks |
| `get_mev_pool_total()` | Query total MEV pool (pending distribution) |
| `finalize_mev_redistribution(admin)` | Admin function to finalize MEV redistribution |

### Example: MEV Protection Workflow

```
1. Alice deposits 1000 USDC with 1% penalty, locked for 1000 seconds
   → deposit_id = 0

2. Alice submits MEV commit (private order details via hash):
   commit_hash = Keccak256(usdc_addr || 1000 || 102 || nonce)
   mev_commit(alice, 0, commit_hash)
   → Status: Committed

3. Within 30 minutes, Alice reveals her actual transaction:
   mev_reveal(alice, 0, usdc_addr, 1000, 102, nonce)
   → Contract verifies hash matches
   → Status: Revealed
   → Price sample recorded

4. Contract detects sandwich attack via TWAP:
   If current_price (102) deviates from TWAP (100) by > 200 bps
   → MEV attack detected!
   → 2 USDC recovered and added to MEV pool
   → Event: mev_detected(alice, 0, 200, 2)

5. Alice claims her recovery:
   mev_recovered = claim_mev_recovery(alice)
   → Returns: 2 USDC
   → Tokens transferred to alice
```

### Configuration

| Constant | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MEV_REVEAL_WINDOW_SECS` | 1,800 (30 min) | Time allowed to reveal after commit |
| `MEV_PRICE_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD_BPS` | 200 (2%) | Deviation threshold to trigger detection |

For more details, see **[MEV_PROTECTION.md](./MEV_PROTECTION.md)**.

## Contract API

### Initialization

#### `initialize(admin, fee_recipient, max_deposit?, max_lock_secs?)`
One-time setup. Sets admin and fee recipient. Optionally overrides compile-time limits.

---

### Core Functions

#### `deposit(depositor, token, amount, unlock_time, penalty_bps) -> u32`
Locks tokens. Returns the deposit ID.

#### `deposit_for(payer, depositor, token, amount, unlock_time, penalty_bps) -> u32`
Payer funds a vault for a different beneficiary.

#### Smart wallets and delegated deposits
Smart wallets use their contract address as `depositor`; the vault relies on Soroban `require_auth()` and does not require an EOA. Multisig and account-abstraction wallets keep their own approval policy and authorize the vault and token calls.

For time-bounded delegated funding, use `authorize_session_key`, `deposit_with_session_key`, and `revoke_session_key`. The session key is the payer, while the smart wallet remains the deposit owner. See [Smart Wallet Integration](docs/SMART_WALLETS.md) for the security model and integration checklist.

#### `deposit_by_ledger(depositor, token, amount, unlock_ledger, penalty_bps) -> u32`
Locks tokens until a specific Stellar ledger sequence number is reached, instead of a wall-clock timestamp.

Use this when you need to express a lock period in terms of on-chain ledger progression — for example, "release after the network has produced exactly N more ledgers" — rather than relying on the ledger's timestamp field.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `depositor` | `Address` | Account locking the tokens. Must sign the transaction. |
| `token` | `Address` | SAC-compatible token contract address. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Amount to lock (> 0, ≤ `max_deposit`). |
| `unlock_ledger` | `u32` | Ledger sequence number at or after which withdrawal is permitted. Must be > `current_ledger + 12` (minimum gap of 12 ledgers ≈ 60 seconds at 5 s/ledger). |
| `penalty_bps` | `u32` | Early-exit penalty in basis points (0–10000). Requires a `fee_recipient` to be configured if > 0. |

**Returns** the deposit ID (`u32`), shared with the same per-depositor counter as timestamp-based deposits.

**Withdrawal** — `withdraw()` and `withdraw_to()` both accept ledger-based deposits. On withdrawal the contract checks `env.ledger().sequence() >= unlock_ledger`; if the ledger sequence has not yet reached the target the call fails with `FundsStillLocked`.

**Estimating wall-clock time from a ledger number** — Stellar produces a new ledger roughly every 5 seconds. To approximate the unlock time in seconds from the current ledger:

```
estimated_seconds = (unlock_ledger - current_ledger) × 5
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is an ESTIMATE, not a guaranteed prediction.**
>
> - Actual ledger close times vary by ±1-2 seconds depending on network conditions
> - The 5-second value is a Stellar network consensus target, not a hard guarantee
> - Use this estimate for UI display and rough scheduling only
> - Do **not** rely on this for precise, critical timing — use timestamp-based deposits instead
> - When withdrawal is called, the actual check is `current_ledger >= unlock_ledger`, which is exact
> - The `time_remaining(depositor, id)` query returns `(remaining_ledgers × 5)` for ledger-based deposits, which is the same estimate
>
> See the **"Ledger-Based Deposit Time Estimation: Precision & Confidence"** section below for a detailed decision tree, use-case guidance, and accuracy details.

#### `withdraw(depositor, deposit_id)`
Withdraws if `now >= unlock_time`.

#### `withdraw_to(depositor, deposit_id, recipient)`
Withdraws to a different address.

#### `cancel_deposit(depositor, deposit_id)`
Early exit with penalty. Penalty is split: 30% goes to fee_recipient, 70% accumulates in the staker rewards pool; remainder returned to depositor.

---

### Staker Registry Functions

The staker registry allows users to register as stakers and earn a portion of penalties accrued from early deposit exits. This creates an incentive mechanism where stakers share in the penalties paid by users who exit early.

#### `register_staker(staker, amount) -> Result<(), VaultError>`
Register or update a staker's stake amount.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `staker` | `Address` | The staker's address. Must sign the transaction. |
| `amount` | `i128` | Stake amount in contract tokens (> 0). |

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success, or an error code if validation fails.

**Behavior**
- Validates that `amount > 0` — zero or negative amounts are rejected with `InvalidStakeAmount`.
- Updates the staker's entry if already registered, or creates a new entry.
- Maintains `total_staked` (sum of all registered stakes) for proportional reward calculation.
- Adds the staker to the staker list on first registration.
- Emits a `StakerRegistered` event.
- Requires authentication from the staker.

**Example**
```rust
// Alice registers with 1000 tokens as stake
vault.register_staker(&alice, &1000)?;

// Later, Alice increases her stake to 2000
vault.register_staker(&alice, &2000)?;
```

#### `claim_staker_rewards(staker) -> Result<(), VaultError>`
Claim accumulated rewards from the staker rewards pool.

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `staker` | `Address` | The staker claiming rewards. Must sign the transaction. |

**Returns** `Ok(())` on success, or an error code if no rewards are available or staker is not registered.

**Behavior**
- Validates that the staker is registered — returns `StakerNotFound` if not.
- Calculates the staker's proportional share: `(stake_amount / total_staked) × rewards_pool`.
- Validates that the calculated reward is > 0 — returns `NoRewardsToClaim` if the pool is empty or the proportion rounds to zero.
- Deducts the reward from the rewards pool.
- Tracks cumulative rewards claimed per staker for auditing.
- Emits a `RewardsClaimed` event.
- Requires authentication from the staker.

**Example**
```rust
// Alice claims her proportional share of the rewards pool
vault.claim_staker_rewards(&alice)?;

// If Alice has stake 1000 and total_staked is 4000, and rewards_pool is 700:
// Alice's reward = (1000 / 4000) × 700 = 175 tokens
```

---

### Penalty Splitting & Rewards Pool

When a user calls `cancel_deposit()` to exit early, the penalty is split as follows:

| Recipient | Percentage | Basis Points |
|---|---|---|
| Fee Recipient | 30% | 3000 bps |
| Staker Rewards Pool | 70% | 7000 bps |

**Example**
If a user cancels a deposit with 100 tokens penalty (10% of 1000):
- Fee Recipient receives 30 tokens (100 × 0.30)
- Staker Rewards Pool receives 70 tokens (100 × 0.70)

Registered stakers can then claim their proportional share of the rewards pool based on their stake amount relative to total staked.

#### `renew_deposit(depositor, deposit_id, new_unlock_time, penalty_bps)`
Renews an existing timestamp-based deposit after its current unlock time has been reached. The depositor must authorize the call. The new unlock time must be in the future and satisfy the configured minimum and maximum lock duration; the penalty must be 0–10000 basis points and requires a configured fee recipient when non-zero. The amount and deposit ID remain unchanged. A `deposit_renewed` event includes the depositor, token, deposit ID, unchanged amount, old and new unlock times, and updated penalty. The deposit becomes withdrawable again when the new unlock time is reached. Ledger-based deposits are not renewable.

---

### Admin Functions

#### `emergency_withdraw(admin, depositor, deposit_id)`
Admin-only. Returns funds to depositor regardless of lock time.

#### `pause(admin)` / `unpause(admin)`
Halts / restores deposits.

#### `transfer_admin(admin, new_admin)` / `accept_admin(new_admin)`
Two-step admin transfer.

#### `cancel_transfer_admin(admin)`
Cancels a pending transfer.

#### `renounce_admin(admin)`
Permanently removes admin. Contract becomes fully trustless.

---

### Read-only Queries

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `get_vault(depositor, id)` | `Option<VaultEntry>` |
| `get_deposit_ids(depositor)` | `Vec<u32>` |
| `time_remaining(depositor, id)` | `u64` seconds |
| `get_time()` | Current ledger timestamp |
| `version()` | `String` — contract version from Cargo.toml |
| `get_admin()` | `Option<Address>` |
| `get_pending_admin()` | `Option<Address>` |
| `get_fee_recipient()` | `Option<Address>` |
| `get_constants()` | `(max_deposit, max_lock_secs)` |
| `get_depositor_count()` | `u32` |
| `get_depositors(offset, limit)` | `Page<Address>` — items + total_count |
| `is_paused()` | `bool` |
| `is_initialized()` | `bool` |

## Sustainability Metrics

SAFE-HAVEN tracks environmental impact across all deposits to support ESG goals and climate commitments.

### Carbon Footprint Tracking

Each deposit automatically calculates a **carbon footprint** based on:
- **Amount locked** — larger deposits = higher impact
- **Lock duration** — longer locks = higher impact
- **Baseline multiplier** — configurable environmental cost per unit-second (default: 1 gram CO2e per unit per second)

**Formula**: `carbon_footprint = amount × duration_seconds × CARBON_BASELINE_PER_UNIT_SECOND`

### Renewable Energy Percentage

Every deposit tracks an assumed **renewable energy percentage** (default: 50%). This represents the energy mix used for hosting and network operations.

### Carbon Offset Integration

Users can configure a **penalty basis points** (0–10,000) that simultaneously:
1. **Penalizes early withdrawals** — funds are sent to the fee recipient
2. **Offsets carbon** — penalty % is converted to CO2 offset

**Formula**: `carbon_offset = carbon_footprint × (penalty_bps / 10,000)`

### Sustainability Metrics Queries

#### `get_sustainability_metrics(depositor, deposit_id) -> Option<SustainabilityMetrics>`
Retrieves calculated metrics for a single deposit:
```rust
pub struct SustainabilityMetrics {
    pub deposit_id: u32,
    pub depositor: Address,
    pub carbon_footprint: i128,           // grams CO2e
    pub renewable_energy_percent: u32,   // 0-100%
    pub carbon_offset_grams: i128,       // grams CO2 offset
    pub timestamp: u64,                  // when recorded
}
```

#### `generate_sustainability_report(depositor) -> SustainabilityReport`
Aggregates metrics across all active deposits:
```rust
pub struct SustainabilityReport {
    pub depositor: Address,
    pub total_carbon_footprint: i128,        // sum across all deposits
    pub average_renewable_energy_percent: u32, // weighted average
    pub total_carbon_offset: i128,           // sum of all offsets
    pub active_deposit_count: u32,           // number of open vaults
    pub report_timestamp: u64,
}
```

### Sustainability Milestones

The contract emits `SustainabilityMilestone` events when depositors achieve environmental goals:

| Milestone | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Carbon Neutral** | 100% of carbon footprint is offset |
| **High Renewable** | ≥ 75% renewable energy across deposits |
| **Carbon Negative** | Total offset exceeds total footprint |
| **Large Offset** | Total offset ≥ 1 billion grams CO2e (1,000 tonnes) |

**Behavior**: Each milestone is emitted at most once per depositor (using a bitmap flag). Once achieved, the same milestone will not emit again unless reset.

### Lifecycle of Metrics

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| **Deposit** | Metrics calculated, stored, aggregates updated, milestones checked |
| **Withdraw** | Metrics removed from storage (no longer needed) |
| **Cancel** | Metrics removed, aggregates decremented |
| **Query** | `get_sustainability_metrics()` and `generate_sustainability_report()` read-only (no writes) |

### Example: Tracking a Sustainable Vault

```
1. Alice deposits 1,000 USDC for 100 days with 50% early-exit penalty
   → carbon_footprint = 1,000 × 8,640,000 seconds × 1 = 8.64 billion grams CO2e
   → carbon_offset = 8.64 billion × 0.5 = 4.32 billion grams (50% offset)

2. She makes a second deposit of 500 USDC for 50 days with 100% penalty
   → carbon_footprint = 500 × 4,320,000 × 1 = 2.16 billion grams
   → carbon_offset = 2.16 billion (full offset)

3. Her sustainability report shows:
   → total_carbon_footprint = 10.8 billion grams
   → total_carbon_offset = 6.48 billion grams
   → average_renewable_energy = 50%
   → SustainabilityMilestone::HighRenewable is NOT emitted (50% < 75% threshold)
   → SustainabilityMilestone::LargeOffset IS emitted (6.48B > 1B threshold)
```

## Soroban Developer Notes

### Ledger TTL and Storage Expiry

Soroban uses a **time-to-live (TTL)** system for all persistent storage entries. Every entry written to the ledger has a limited lifespan — measured in ledgers, not wall-clock time — after which it **expires and is pruned**. If a storage entry expires, reading it returns `None` as if it were never written.

SAFE-HAVEN mitigates this by bumping TTL on every storage write and read that matters:

- **On write**: every `set_*` helper calls `extend_ttl` with a `BUMP_TARGET` that covers the maximum lock duration (~5 years) plus a `BUMP_THRESHOLD` buffer.
- **On read**: the `get_deposit` (mutable) helper also extends TTL. The `*_readonly` variants do *not* extend TTL — they are used by queries that should not incur a write-cost.
- **Edge case**: a deposit that sits untouched for longer than `BUMP_TARGET` ledgers (~31.5M ledgers) could theoretically expire. In practice this exceeds the maximum lock duration, and any withdrawal attempt would need to re-create the entry via a migration or re-deposit.

**Takeaway**: always use the write-path `get_deposit` (not `get_deposit_readonly`) for operations that will later mutate the entry. Read-only queries (like `get_vault`) use the readonly variant to avoid unnecessary ledger writes.

### Instruction Budget Limits

Every Soroban transaction has a **CPU instruction budget** (default ~100M instructions for testnet, ~50M for mainnet). Functions that iterate over unbounded collections can exhaust this budget and fail mid-execution.

SAFE-HAVEN's paginated views respect this limit:

- `get_depositors(offset, limit)` and `get_deposits_page(offset, limit)` use a `limit` parameter and stop early. Keep `limit` ≤ 50 in production.
- `get_vault_batch(depositors, deposit_id)` and `get_deposit_batch(depositor, deposit_ids)` clamp input size to `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (25).
- The `DepositorList` can grow large over time, but `remove_depositor` is O(1) — it clears only a flag. The list is append-only and stale entries are skipped during enumeration.

**Takeaway**: always paginate with reasonable limits. Don't attempt to fetch all deposits or all depositors in a single RPC call.

### Simulation vs. Submission

Soroban distinguishes between two phases of a transaction:

1. **Simulation** — the RPC dry-runs your transaction against the current ledger state to compute the exact footprint, resource fees, and result. Simulation is read-only and free.
2. **Submission** — the signed transaction is broadcast to the network. This consumes real resources and costs fees.

Key implications:

- A simulation that succeeds does **not** guarantee submission will succeed. Ledger state can change between simulation and submission (e.g., another transaction withdraws the funds you were about to claim).
- Always simulate before submitting to catch errors early and estimate fees.
- The frontend's `stellar.ts` helpers simulate first, then submit, and surface any discrepancy as an error.

### `require_auth()` Must Be First

In Soroban, **`require_auth()` must be the very first call in every mutating (non-readonly) contract function**. Calling it after storage reads, transfers, or other operations is an anti-pattern that can lead to:

- **Wasted compute**: if auth fails, all preceding work is discarded but still counted against the instruction budget.
- **Re-entrancy risk**: performing state changes before auth verification opens a window for re-entrant calls.

SAFE-HAVEN enforces this convention: every mutating function calls `caller.require_auth()` as its first meaningful statement (after the function signature). The `Security Properties` table above documents this as "Auth-first".

**Takeaway**: when adding new mutating functions, always put `require_auth()` first. The contract's security model depends on it.

---

## Ledger-Based Deposit Time Estimation: Precision & Confidence

When using `deposit_by_ledger()`, the contract stores a target ledger sequence number. To estimate when that ledger will close in wall-clock time, use the formula:

```
estimated_seconds = (unlock_ledger - current_ledger) × 5
```

### How accurate is this estimate?

**Excellent for rough UI display** (±5–10 seconds over typical durations):
- Stellar's consensus layer targets a 5-second ledger close time on average
- Over a 1-hour lock (720 ledgers), the estimate will typically be within ±2–3 minutes
- For long locks (days or weeks), the relative error shrinks further

**Not suitable for precise scheduling**:
- Actual ledger close times vary by ±1–2 seconds due to network conditions, validator clock skew, and consensus timeouts
- Over-the-counter exchanges, time-sensitive payment settlements, or critical business logic should NOT rely on this estimate
- For exact timing, use timestamp-based deposits (`deposit()`) instead

### When should I use `time_remaining()` for ledger-based deposits?

**Safe to use**:
- Display in a UI dashboard showing "roughly X seconds remaining"
- Showing a progress bar for visual feedback
- Non-critical notifications like "deposit will unlock soon"

**Not safe to use**:
- Calculating precise interest accrual or compounding
- Triggering critical financial workflows ("execute settlement exactly when deposit unlocks")
- Legal or compliance deadlines that require exact timestamps
- Any system that cannot tolerate ±2–5 seconds of error

### Decision tree: Which deposit type should I use?

```
Do you need EXACT wall-clock precision?
├─ YES  → Use deposit() or deposit_for() (timestamp-based)
│        The unlock check is exact: env.ledger().timestamp() >= unlock_time
│
└─ NO   → Do you need to express the lock in ledger terms?
         (e.g., "release after block 12,345,678")?
         ├─ YES  → Use deposit_by_ledger()
         │        Unlock check is exact: env.ledger().sequence() >= unlock_ledger
         │        time_remaining() will return an estimate ±1–2 seconds
         │
         └─ NO   → Use deposit() or deposit_for() (timestamp-based)
                   Simpler, widely supported in the UI, no approximation needed
```

### Implementation Details

The 5-second estimate is defined in `storage.rs::LEDGER_SECONDS`:

```rust
pub const LEDGER_SECONDS: u64 = 5;
```

This constant is used by:
- `contract.rs::time_remaining()` — returns `remaining_ledgers × LEDGER_SECONDS` for ledger-based deposits
- `constants.rs::MIN_LOCK_LEDGERS` — enforces minimum 12 ledgers (~60 seconds)
- Storage TTL calculations — ensures vault state persists longer than maximum lock duration

The estimate formula is deterministic and does not change; network delays may cause the actual ledger close to drift slightly, but the formula itself is reliable for UI purposes.

---

## Known Limitations

The following gaps apply specifically to `deposit_by_ledger` deposits. All other deposit types (`deposit`, `deposit_for`) are unaffected.

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| **No frontend support** | The React UI only exposes `deposit` and `deposit_for`. Ledger-based deposits must be made via the Stellar CLI or a custom SDK integration. |
| **No maximum lock duration** | `deposit` and `deposit_for` reject lock durations longer than `max_lock_secs` (default 5 years). `deposit_by_ledger` only enforces a *minimum* gap of 12 ledgers (`MIN_LOCK_LEDGERS`). There is no equivalent upper-bound check on `unlock_ledger`, so arbitrarily far-future ledger numbers are accepted. |
| **`get_vault` returns `None`** | The `get_vault(depositor, id)` query only searches timestamp-based entries. To retrieve a ledger-based deposit, use `get_ledger_vault(depositor, id)` which returns `Option<LedgerVaultEntry>`. |
| **`time_remaining` is an estimate** | For ledger-based deposits, `time_remaining` returns `remaining_ledgers × 5` seconds. This is an approximation because actual ledger close times vary by ±1-2 seconds and are not exactly 5 seconds. **Do not rely on this value for precise scheduling or critical timing.** Use this estimate for UI display and rough scheduling only. The actual withdrawal check (`current_ledger >= unlock_ledger`) is exact and will work correctly. |
| **`get_deposits_page` excludes ledger-based deposits** | The paginated flat deposits view only iterates over timestamp-based `VaultEntry` records. To enumerate ledger-based deposits, use `get_depositors` + `get_deposit_ids` + `get_ledger_vault`. |

These limitations are tracked as open issues and will be addressed in future releases.

## Prediction Markets

SAFE-HAVEN includes a decentralized prediction market system that allows users to create, bet on, and resolve outcome-based markets tied to deposit behavior. Markets provide price discovery, hedging opportunities, and incentive alignment while remaining resistant to manipulation.

### Market Types

Markets can predict various SAFE-HAVEN deposit outcomes:

| Market Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `aggregate_deposits` | Total value of active deposits | "Sum of all deposits > 1M tokens" |
| `avg_lock_time` | Average deposit lock duration | "Average lock time > 90 days" |
| `unique_depositors` | Number of distinct depositors | "Active depositors > 500" |
| `deposit_distribution` | Distribution across lock periods | "50% locked > 180 days" |
| `penalty_accrual` | Total penalties collected | "Penalties > 50K tokens" |

### Market Architecture

**Two-phase resolution**:
1. **Betting Phase** — Users place bets until `close_time`
2. **Resolution Phase** — Oracle submits outcome between `close_time` and `resolution_deadline`

**Anti-manipulation mechanisms**:
- **Authorized oracles** — Only designated oracle can resolve each market
- **Resolution deadline** — Forces resolution within a fixed window
- **Duplicate submission prevention** — Oracle can submit once per market
- **Outcome validation** — Invalid outcomes rejected at submission time
- **Market closure required** — Resolution only possible on closed markets
